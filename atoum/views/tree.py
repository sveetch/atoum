        This recursive tree is highly innefficient on database queries.
        Usage of ``prefetch_related`` is not enough to avoid cascade of queryset for
        products.

        If this view is to be keeped, it will need to be optimized with a tree resolving
        that would gather objects of respectively all consumables, assortments,
        categories and then products.

    .. TODO::
        possibly cache it ?
